9,Avengers: Endgame,3,its good enough for me to watch it twice enjoyable just I didnt like the start or the middle that much finnal battle is a banger tho
9,Avengers: Endgame,5,"WOW! JUST WOW! Being a Marvel fan for all my life, this was just too satisfying to watch. Brilliantly made film with great CGI and an epic battle to finish this epic saga."
9,Avengers: Endgame,5,"Probably, in general, the greatest film of all time, everyone comes together for the final battle of Marvel's world-shattering Infinity Saga. It's not only everyone in the MCU, but also everyone in real life--audiences were blown away by the moments in this movie and the incredible emotional impact it left on its dedicated fans. It's a cinematic achievement that may never be achieved again, one that deserves to be learned about in history class."
9,Avengers: Endgame,5,"The build-up of the Marvel Cinematic Universe has all come down to this. The hype around this movie was well deserved as we got an amazing end to the Infinity Saga. Seeing character developments come to a perfect end, this movie hits all the rights notes in terms of battles, visual effects, emotions, jokes, and the fun that Marvel is known for. One of the best Marvel movies of all time and is sure to hold up for a long time. No doubt that Avengers: Endgame has assembled 5 stars"
9,Avengers: Endgame,4,My rating for the film is a 8.9/10
9,Avengers: Endgame,5,"Completamente impactante, un cierre excepcional para algunos personajes y un perfecto inicio para las próximas entregas."
9,Avengers: Endgame,4,"I think this movie came with many expectations, and i personally stay with this one of all the 20 something movies from the MCU; this movie has it ALL. Everytime i watch this movie, i feel marvel took it personal, and that is something big for me, like they did after with Spiderman: No way home."
9,Avengers: Endgame,5,"This movie is just the perfect ending to 10 years movie mega project. ""EPIC"" is the only word that can describe this movie"
9,Avengers: Endgame,5,very sad butt epic movie 
9,Avengers: Endgame,5,Best movie ever made. That was amazing. Oh my god that is my favorite movie of all time. Brought to tars a million times. The most epic movie ever 100000/10 you have to watch it. Cry every time
7,Avengers: Infinity War,4,"It never seemed as surprising or shocking to me as everyone else, but it is certainly a great movie with an uncomfortable narrative, great action, a great villain and it makes our effort worth following all the MCU movies."
7,Avengers: Infinity War,5,Beautiful build-up to the epic finale of this Infinity saga
7,Avengers: Infinity War,5,Yeah. It's really THAT good.
7,Avengers: Infinity War,4,My rating for the film is a 8.7/10
7,Avengers: Infinity War,5,"Perfeito! Dramaturgia, personagens, ação, humor na medida e um final memorável!"
6,Black Panther,3,Extremely overrated and I am definitely not a huge fan of it.
6,Black Panther,5,"The first Black-led superhero film in the MCU's long line of installments proves to be one that will never lose its momentum. While being review-bombed by incels who believe that having a Black lead makes a film ""woke"", it survives completely thanks to its brilliant visuals, characters, down-to-earthness, and plot. Watch out world--T'Challa is claiming his rightful throne!"
6,Black Panther,4,My rating for the film is a 8.3/10
6,Black Panther,5,Oh my godness love it. Best marvel movie fr. It makes in a way that no other does.
6,Black Panther,4,"This movie is different than many in the MCU. It deals with an entire nation, with a special access to resources and technologies based on those resources. The idea that this nation has kept it's true capabilities a secret is interesting, and the movie manages to pull off an acceptable level of credibility. Enough for me to enjoy the movie at any rate."
6,Black Panther,2,This is one of the most overrated films I've ever seen considering it's high praise I praise it certainly did not live up to any of those expectations a very mediocre film at best with thei'm at best with very cringy corny CGI
6,Black Panther,2,It took 3 attempts to actually be able to see the whole movie.  The story was so engaging I fell asleep the first two times.  Overall it was solidly in the middle of the pack of Marvel movies
6,Black Panther,4,"The movie is  awesome. It was colorful , loads of action and a few humor in the movie. It was so good I watched it multiple times"
6,Black Panther,5,Loved it. We miss you black panther.
6,Black Panther,2,i didnt like so much CGI was not great and it didnt really have a good story
11,Black Widow,4,"Black Widow doesn't have many glaring issues--but the ones it does have stick out like a sore thumb. While having a great cast with great chemistry, and a nice progressive undertone, its treatment of the villain disappointed many fans, which is why it may be shoved to the sidelines by other big Marvel titles. However, what it gets right is really good, like its action, its setting, and Scarlett Johansson."
11,Black Widow,4,One of the best movies in the Marvel franchise. The bond between the female leads makes this a fun and entertaining movie that pulls at your heartstrings as well as you to the edge of your seat. The family dynamic is orchestrated perfectly and therefore keeps you from wanting to look away from the screen. A must-see for any Marvel fan
11,Black Widow,3,My rating for the film is a 7.9/10
11,Black Widow,2,"If this movie came up a little bit early I think it might be good. But unfortunately, this movie came after the event of avenger: endgame, and this movie feel empty because the black widow's sacrifices in the endgame really emotional. Watching this movie is like seeing a dead character and for me is not a great feeling. This movie exists only to set up Yelena's character in a future film. Overall the story is decent and the good thing about this movie is just the action scene is kinda great."
11,Black Widow,5,I love this movie because we got to know more of Natasha's past and her other family that she loves.
11,Black Widow,4,I love Marvel Movies so....... I loved it! Female superhero LOVE EM!
11,Black Widow,2,got made to late and kind of boring
11,Black Widow,3,The beginning of this film captured the essence of what I wanted the rest of it to be. Unfortunately it was toned down; there could have been more seriousness included to truly shine.
11,Black Widow,3,A fun spy thriller that came 5+ years too late. They shouldn't have waited till this character was dead to give her a film of her own. It serves to introduce Florence Pugh's Yelena who is a great character performed well by her.
11,Black Widow,2,"Disney siendo Disney, aburridísima, con incongruencias de guion, los personajes desaprovechados, CGI malo, otra película dirigida a niños sin sangre, ni acción ni nada de coreografías decentes. Mala suerte por Scarlett."
8,Captain Marvel,5,"This movie is very special to me, not only because of the participation of Brie and Samuel, but the stories of Captain Marvel are amazing and the movie itself is very captivating!"
8,Captain Marvel,4,"Really enjoyable origin story with lots of unique characters, lore and super impressive CGI. "
8,Captain Marvel,4,"Although being review-bombed by misogynist bigots, Captain Marvel still isn't all THAT good. Brie Larson may have needed more time to figure things out, and some cringey writing definitely needed to be revised. It maintains its four stars due to a compelling plot and a fantastic performance from Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury--but we already knew that."
8,Captain Marvel,2,Captain Marvel just needs more in-depth character. Watching her in the story is just uninspiring. Because the story is boring and unengaging. The only good thing about this movie is young nick's furry and the plot twist of the Skrull.
8,Captain Marvel,5,"Injustiçado! Delícia de filme! Leve, despretensioso e emocionante."
8,Captain Marvel,5,This movie is the long kiss goodnight with geena Davis but in space
8,Captain Marvel,3,"Best thing about this movie was the special effects. I wanted to give it lower marks because I personally just don't like the main lead, but I have to be fail and balanced. And this movie was actually not as bad as most people make it out to be. I get that we all don't like the main actress but we can't destroy the film over it. It was a mediocre film and the effects were good. It wasn't a bad movie, it just wasn't good. Plot wasn't great, acting was mediocre."
8,Captain Marvel,0,Captain Marvel was just awful. The leads acting was as dry as a over cooked piece of toast and as entertaining as watching paint dry.  The writing was not great. This character seems so forced down our throats and so OP to further force it that it was hard to be interested. Maybe focusing on better writing will make this character and future movies more like able. This was awful.
14,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,2,Let's face it it's bollocks. Well acted but the plot is now cuckolded by the impressive special effects and the new law of thermodynamics which maintains everything related to superheroes must be fantastic.
2,Jurassic World,3,My rating for the film is a 7.3/10
2,Jurassic World,5,I really liked the direction they took with this movie. It was fun.
2,Jurassic World,4,"Nostalgica, entretenida, sorpresivamente bien estructurada en el aspecto argumental."
2,Jurassic World,4,"Ich bin ein Fan der gesamten Jurassic Reihe und Jurassic World ist absolut sehenswert. Gute Darsteller, Nick Robinson kann sein Potenzial noch steigern. Und ein sehr guter Schauspieler werden."
2,Jurassic World,2,Fun to see on the big screen but lacks the magic the original had while trying so hard to emulate it.
2,Jurassic World,4,"Not great, but not terrible either. Good ideas and recycled concepts. The visuals are what saved this for me to give it such high marks. But boy did the follow up to this movie drop the ball."
2,Jurassic World,5,"We finally get to see the park open and it was definitely worth the wait! Jurassic world is immensely entertaining, action packed, and a true runner up to the original classic!"
2,Jurassic World,5,GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
2,Jurassic World,4,Great Movie a lot like the original Jurassic Park but still different and holds its especially the effects and Chris Pratt does a great job making this movie funny and entertaining so does Bryce Dallas Howard I recommend it. 9/10
2,Jurassic World,0,"Chris Pratt is not a good actor, and the Jurrasic movies just cement that opinion"
3,Logan,5,"Everything you could want in a dark, gritty, and violent super hero film. The writing for this film is fantastic and the acting is even better. Hugh Jackman leads this film perfectly but all of his co cast members do an excellent job to make this film feel as real as possible. The gore in this film is crazy but not distracting or over the top. The twists and turns of this story are executed to near perfection and the emotion of this story is strong."
3,Logan,5,Amazing. One of the few truly great marvel movies.
3,Logan,5,James Mangold's gritty take on the superhero Wolverine is an interesting and welcome take on the old man with claws and a big heart. A film that nostalgically reminds you of the original X-Men while propelling forward in this unique story that Hugh Jackman skillfully displays with every emotion. An unforgettable movie that pulls you in with every scene.
3,Logan,4,Really good. We need more R rated marvel movies.
3,Logan,4,"As a superhero drama in which main part takes not the action scenes but emotional feelings of characters, that is a small change in Marvel universe."
3,Logan,5,What a way to end an impactful characters legacy. It has some surprises that I didn't expect which led to an even more entertaining story. I felt like I was on the edge of my seat during the whole thing. Was also filled with so many emotions where I just didn't want the movie to end. This was definitely Hugh Jackman at his peak.
13,Sonic the Hedgehog 2,3,Good movie although got a bit of filler
13,Sonic the Hedgehog 2,4,difference between paramount and disgusting netflix
13,Sonic the Hedgehog 2,3,"Not as good as the first movie but still worth the watch for sure. Much like many movies of our time there are a lot of ""funny"" moments that fall flat."
13,Sonic the Hedgehog 2,5,"I even liked the parts with the humans, cause they were pretty funny to be honest. The only part im like, ehhhh, is the dance-off, that felt pretty weird. But oh well."
13,Sonic the Hedgehog 2,4,Reached out to my expectations. Fairly.
5,Star Wars: The Last Jedi,0,"Last Jedi was my first disappointment in life with a Star Wars content. I left the theater and I was stunned, I couldn't believe the garbage that I had watched. Thanks Rian Johnson and Disney to make me feel so miserable with something that always gave me so much joy."
5,Star Wars: The Last Jedi,0,"a huge disaster, should've never switch directors"
5,Star Wars: The Last Jedi,3,My rating for the film is a 6.7/10
5,Star Wars: The Last Jedi,3,"I decided to finally review this movie after a lot of time and after watching it a few times. Because I still was trying to figure out why so many people hated this movie. And I'm just going to say that yes it has some definite flaws, but I still think it's way better than The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, and The Rise of Skywalker, which I like less and less each time I watch that one."
5,Star Wars: The Last Jedi,0,I would give negative ten stars if I could. The kindest thing I can say is that this movie was just terrible. And that's the kindest thing I can say.
5,Star Wars: The Last Jedi,0,This film was nearly unwatchable trash that only gets points for being pretty but falls apart under any reasonable scrutiny.
5,Star Wars: The Last Jedi,3,"I was confused about what I should give this film but I gave it the highest my heart would let me a 3.5. This film messes with Luke Skywalker and who he is at his core. This film also messes up Finn's character, they should have let him die giving his character purpose and meaning. This film was not hot trash but is far from good."
5,Star Wars: The Last Jedi,0,"The Last Jedi is not only an insult to the very foundations of what makes Star Wars such a beautiful escape from reality, but it is also a downright sloppy movie with blatant plot holes that run throughout the movie's entirety. With appalling writing and plot lines so confusing and pointless they make Admiral Holdo's plan look genius, this abomination is one of the worst examples of ""story"" telling to ever be created."
10,Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,0,This movie is so bad that I'm getting sad and tired as I type this single line review.
10,Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,0,"Yes, sucks bad. Bad, bad."
10,Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,3,"not that good of a movie, but an amazing save from the last movie which was a disaster..."
10,Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,3,My rating for the film is a 6.8/10
10,Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,2,"I only gave this a 2 star rather than half a star because The Last Jedi (TLJ) made it impossible for anyone to get this movie right. The plot of the movie just doesn't make sense. ""Somehow Palpatine returned"", yeah somehow... So getting thrown down an engine shaft straight into the core of the death star is a survivable experience - This is not an ability that has ever been discussed, but they pass it off by saying ""The Dark side is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural"" stealing the line out of RoTS but out of context. All this means is that Darth Vader died for nothing, this is a MAJOR PLOT HOLE - the prophecy of the chosen one is that Anakin/Vader would bring balance to the force and destroy the Sith - Before this movie, the prophecy was intact. The Plot is also full of coincidences, Lando just happens to be on the planet to provide assistance just as the gang turn up, without him they would be captured, he just so happens to know the location they need to look for the way finder, they get this dagger by complete luck after falling through some kind of new quicksand that happens to have tunnels underneath, the dagger is inscribed in the language of the Sith, C3PO can translate it but cant tell anyone so this leads them on a stupid side quest to reveal the location of the wayfinder... The whole movie just feels like coincidence after coincidence rather than logical decisions are being made to advance the movie. "
10,Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,0,Negative stars. The one great character they had in this movie was not the main lead and he was abused by the horrible plot and storytelling.
10,Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,1,"I gotta be brutally honest, this movie is not good at all. This movie spends most of its time trying to undo The Last Jedi which is a very cowardly thing to do. As someone who actually liked The Last Jedi, that really annoyed me. Because now I can't watch Force Awakens and Last Jedi without thinking that this is how the trilogy ends. The ending itself is just trash. For a standalone film the ending could work but this is the ending to a nine part saga. And it's a rushed mess that you will probably forget about what happened at points when you finish it. The one word that can describe this movie is Overwhelming and not in a good way. I also hate that Palpatine is in this movie. It completely ruins Anakins sacrifice. But I gotta give credit where it's due, Ian Mcdiarmid was phenomenal as Palpatine. In fact, all the actors were giving it their all. This movie does have good moments but if I'm judging the whole thing, I can't give it a good score. This movie is proof that Disney had no plan whatsoever with this trilogy."
10,Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,0,Terrible end to George Lucas' next level story telling
10,Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,4,great effect good story
10,Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,2,Why does this film have to be so dumb? They gave up on trying something new and instead brought back a villain who already served his purpose. This movie was the best I could have been coming off the previous film which was not good either.
1,Thor,3,"It's better than The Incredible Hulk, but that doesn't make it great. It's just a little too boring. It doesn't hold up for a rewatch, and it's a chore to get through the first time, too. The movie is saved by stellar performances from Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Tom Hiddleston, Stellan Skarsgård, and Kat Dennings."
1,Thor,2,This movie at times is very boring and fails to keep the viewers interest. At times the movie feels very lifeless and dull however it does pass the time and is an alright introduction to Thor.
1,Thor,4,"Such an under rated MCU film. A great origin story that introduces one of the classic Avengers and villains beautifully, in a very Shakespearean style. Good drama and absolutely beautiful soundtrack from Patrick Doyle. I revisited this movie after sitting through the catastrophic Thor 4, and was so relieved and happy to see this movie take Thor seriously: his character and story are not the constant butt of jokes. I still think this is the best Thor movie. Love and Thunder was terrible, and Ragnarok, while cool at the time,has lost some of its luster as the jokes and belittling of Thor have grown old. Thor 1 still feels fresh, 11 years later. It's more of a thoughtful film than an action film, and I love it for that. It prioritizes a good story over explosions and colors. It's substance over spectacle."
1,Thor,1,Pathetic and stupid..Thor should be wearing a clown suit. This movie is comical and 10yr olds would probably love it.
1,Thor,4,This is one of those films that is actually better on a repeat viewing. The use of Dutch angles is atrocious but the story is well written. A good foundation for turning one of the most consistently boring Marvel heroes into someone interesting enough to warrant a film fanbase.
1,Thor,3,One of the less good marvel movies but still good.
1,Thor,3,"The 4th MCU film, Kenneth Branagh gives us a compelling enough story, talented cast and a stunning world environment. Asgard is stunning, it's the first time we see it on the big screen and it doesn't disappoint, especially for 2011. This film gives us the beginning of Thor's tragic character arc, is this film he's a arrogant, almost childish character. The first film is the most serious of the 4 and I appreciate that, I love what Thor becomes but the first film tried something and although it didn't pay off as much as the later films it is still entertaining and worth a watch."
1,Thor,5,"After i see Thor 4 ,THIS first movie is the best Thor movie ,reflects the real character (i mean ,COMICS) ... maybe Thor 2 have some flaws ,but 3 and 4 is garbage."
1,Thor,2,well I was expecting a lot more it was okay but I wont be paying to see this one a second time in the theater. it was a little boring and the comedy in it was dumb. and the climax fight was bad. I guess the MCU has decided to take lessons from Kathleen Kennedy
1,Thor,5,Best Thor to this day ... The origin story is just amazing
15,Thor: Love and Thunder,1,"I loved Ragnarok (and I really liked all of Taika Waititi's other movies), but this was like the palest shadow of that. The jokes all fell flat, the plot points seemed horribly forced, Bale was wasted. Russell Crowe was ok. I'd honestly rather watch the Eternals again."
15,Thor: Love and Thunder,2,"The movie is lacklustre compared to other marval movies at best, the movie try's to pull poor jokes at every corner and is somewhat of a bore to watch, a lot of key plot points in the movie are just scratched over and don't make sense when Considering an actual narrative, in short the movie feels like a tired spinoff that shouldn't have made the cut."
15,Thor: Love and Thunder,2,The laziest MCU rendition yet! Dumb Thor isn't exactly my cup of tea!
15,Thor: Love and Thunder,5,I thought it was one of Marvel's funniest movies and had a nice Rhythm between being funny and serious when it needed to be. The stakes felt appropriate and it was nice to take a break from the massive Stakes of other Marvel movies.
15,Thor: Love and Thunder,5,One of my favourite Marvel movies.
15,Thor: Love and Thunder,3,"Meh exactly. entertaining, very well made, but missing something. I feel like there was another story line trapped in this movie someplace, very powerful actors mixed with very ""meh"" actors. feels like there's two movies trying to make it into one."
4,Thor: Ragnarok,5,The greatest 02 hours: and 10 minutes ever!!!!!!!!!! It is not ****ing bull****!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The bad reviews can lick a p***y and c***!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Thor: Ragnarok,4,Chris Hemsworth and the rest of the cast have great chemistry in this movie. The storyline and comedy are well written.
4,Thor: Ragnarok,4,"This movie got the right balance of story, plot, humor, action, and drama.  It is by far the best Thor movie and enjoyable to watch as a stand alone"
4,Thor: Ragnarok,4,Fun movie with lots of jokes
4,Thor: Ragnarok,5,"Taika Waititi swoops in at just the right moment to save Thor in the MCU. One of the funniest MCU films to date, it blew audiences away all around the world, completely reinventing the formula, and giving Thor the re-work that was required after his somewhat disastrous second movie. WIth amazing characters and an amazing cast, Thor: Ragnarok is a magnificent achievement in cinema."
4,Thor: Ragnarok,4,My rating for the film is a 8.6/10
4,Thor: Ragnarok,5,"Thor: Ragnarok is the BEST Thor movie. I've seen all of them. Thor (2011), Thor: The Dark World (2013), and Thor: Love and Thunder (2022). Ragnarok wasn't too serious, but it wasn't too funny. It had just the right amount of humor and seriousness to balance it out."
4,Thor: Ragnarok,4,My 2nd favorite Marvel movie great execution amazing at the sequel was so terrible in comparison
4,Thor: Ragnarok,2,"Regia scarsa, per un film senza né capo né coda."
4,Thor: Ragnarok,5,Quite the tone change compared to the first two movies. This was really fun.
12,Eternals,4,Excellent movie and a magnificent adventure.
